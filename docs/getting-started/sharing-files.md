# Sharing Files in Space

!!! info

    File sharing is currently disabled in Space's closed Beta and will be added shortly as the Beta is made open to public. 

After uploading files in Space, you can share them securely with whoever you want! Share them with other Space users, using any of the many possible username or address options users have when signing up:

- Email
- Twitter handle
- Ethereum Key
- Name
- *More coming soon!*

File sharing has two main categories: **private file sharing, and public file sharing.**

## Private File Sharing
### Sending Files to Individual People

When it comes to sharing file privately, users can send invites via the methods mentioned above to other users, or non-users when it comes to email.

When you share a file privately with someone, it is done in a safe and end-to-end encrypted way. That user will be given access to view, and decrypt **that specific file only** and you can revoke access anytime.

## Public File Sharing
### Using Public Links
Files can be made public using public links. When made public, a file will remain decrypted and the file's public URL will be accessible for anyone to view, download, and share. Public files **can be turned back to private**.
